# FoxGuard Foundation Libraries

## ðŸ“š About

These are libraries that FoxGuard has developed over the course of several years of internal commercially-driven software engineering projects.

## ðŸ“¦ How to Get Them

All changes to `master` are continously delivered to the public NuGet feed under [our organization](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/foxguardsolutions).

## ðŸ“„ How to Use Them

The APIs that our packages provide are meant to be idiomatic for their respective problem-spaces, and have [structural documentation](https://foxguardsolutions.github.io/Foundation/api/) meant to serve as guidance for such. If this isn't enough to get you going, file an issue for your question and we will try to help you if we can.

## ðŸ’¡ Contributing

If you have something to fix or add - be it code, documentation, a suggestion, or just a question - please feel free to file constructive issues or pull requests, as appropriate.
