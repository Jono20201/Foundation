# FoxGuard Foundation Libraries

## ðŸ“š About

These are libraries that FoxGuard has developed over the course of several years of internal commercially-driven software engineering projects.

## ðŸ“¦ How to Get Them

All changes to `master` are continously delivered to the public NuGet feed under [our organization](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/foxguardsolutions).

## ðŸ“„ How to Use Them

For now, the best documentation of the libraries are the published NuGet packages themselves. For each package, the package descriptions themselves are meant to be helpful, and the public APIs they expose are meant to be idiomatic for each respective problem-space.

## ðŸ’¡ Contributing

If you have something to fix or add - be it code, documentation, or just a question - please feel free to file constructive issues or pull requests, as appropriate.
